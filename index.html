      <p>Good morning! My name is Justin Tucker and this is my portfolio page! I am a former teacher, professor, and now current technical writer at Futurex. I am currently enrolled in web development where I hope to aide my current company with its growth. </p>

      <p>When I lost my job as a collegiate teacher, I was still currently in Colorado although I have now moved back home to San Antonio. As a result, this coding bootcamp portfolio was created during the coding bootcamp at the University of Denver.</p>

      <p>Finally, in this coding bootcamp you will find my current progress as I am working towards my certification as a full-stack developer. As of this writing, I am most proud of my crystal collector game.</p>
