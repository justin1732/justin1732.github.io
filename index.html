      <p>Good morning! My name is Justin Tucker and this is my portfolio page! I am a Technical Writer, FullStack Web Developer, and Media Editor with online collegiate teaching experience and multiple media editing experience. I have earned a certificate in FullStack Web Development from the University of Denver coding bootcamp. I am known to be a communicative problem-solver and hard worker, focusing first on handling the end-user experience. I am effective at seeing the bigger picture of the problem and working to ensure project completion.</p>
     <p>I have previous collegiate experience as a Senior Instructor of English at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs. At UCCS, I worked with hundreds of students, fellow faculty, and program administrators to provide and complete documents, teaching exercises, and classes up to their expectations and desires. This unique background gives me a great deal of experience at handling and working through different stakeholders and their expectations.</p>
      <p>This website was created to highlight all my skills I have gathered from the coding bootcamp, my work experience, and even my education and hobbies. Above, you will see different portfolios for FullStack Web Development Coding, <a href="portfolio.html">here</a>, Technical Writing, <a href="writing.html">here</a>, and Media Editing, <a href="media.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>If you have any comments, suggestions, or concerns, feel free to reach out to me at my contact page <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Thank you!</p>
