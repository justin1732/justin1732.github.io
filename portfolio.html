      <h1>FullStack Web Development Portfolio</h1>
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>As a FullStack Web Developer, I am driven by the desire to create new and exciting websites and applications with my newly-minted skills. At coding bootcamp, I gained technical programming skills with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AJAX, JQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase, Node JS, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Handlebars JS & ReactJS. I used these skills to design innovative Heroku-deployed applications, like my non-Python New York Times Scraper and my ReactJS API searcher Google Books.</p>
      <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
      <p>The stakeholders for a coder are more numerous than probably any other section on this website. A coder has to balance his or her stakeholders by understanding what is doable, what can eventually be done, and what simply cannot happen with the current toolkit the coder has. A coder, unlike the other two on this website, has to be entrusted to say "no" when the code simply will not be able to do that. That "no" should come with a lot of research and Googling, but a coder needs to be able to tell his or her stakeholders the feasibility of any task.</p>
      <h2>Samples</h2>
      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <p>The examples and samples below were created during my coding bootcamp with the University of Denver. Some of these projects were former group projects as well, using AGILE methodology and Kanban GitHub boards and collaboration. The most notable thing about this coding bootcamp is that it was all online and all remote. We had to and needed to work with our fellow coders remotely. This led the way to some good project management tips, tricks, and skills I believe I will be using in the future. As of this writing, I think I am most proud of my Google React Search because it took so long to make look right and work. The non-Python Times Scraper is a close second, because it had to override CORS to work properly and display the image using Handlebars through Cheerio JS.</p>
