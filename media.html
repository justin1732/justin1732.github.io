      <h1>Media Editor Portfolio</h1>
      <h2>About</h2>
<p>As a Media Editor, products and results matter more than the process itself. There are plenty of things you can do to make a video, article, or any other media artifact almost perfect. However, if that piece never comes out, was it worth that perfection? While care and time is important, I believe creating, producing, and publishing the artifact is the most important thing. When doing various videos and other online media for my classes, I worked to have a consistently good product for my students week-after-week, focusing more on producing instead of an idealized perfection.</p>
      <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
      <p>The largest person that a media editor should be concerned about here is the end user. If a video doesn't play correctly, that is on the editor. If the content doesn't come across clearly, the editor needs to be concerned about it and fix it. While the editor needs to be aware and work with other stakeholders, the largest person, even more so than my other two sections on this website, the editor needs to worry about is the end user. If the end user is engaged, other concerns are just not as important. If the end user does not engage, then those concerns need to be addressed before other stakeholders. In the projects below, I demonstrate this:</p>
      <h2>Samples</h2>
      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <p>Putting everything together as a media editor is the hardest part of dealing with that job. As a media editor teaching online classes, I wrote the script, made music (or open sourced it), recorded the video, and the spliced the sound, video, and effects altogether before uploading them to YouTube. Early on in doing this, I used Adobe Premiere Pro for video editing, Audacity for recording, an online web service for making music, a separate microphone for recording my voice, and a camera for my video. As time went on, however, I found that Adobe Elements met most of my needs, Audacity was still used with a separate microphone, but sourcing and giving credit was better for my needs and task. Going forward with different tasks and issues, I will continue to learn and adapt different technologies and strategies for media editing.</p>
      <h3>Longer Video</h3>
      <p>Doing this for an online class has significant drawbacks. The biggest drawback is that videos cannot be longer than 15 minutes and I am limited to whatever video hosting is free or close to free. As a result, everything here is on YouTube. As a video gets longer, however, the task gets longer too. You have to keep mixing audio, being sure your cuts and recording are good (reshooting if necessary), and you have to be sure the topic and script are sharp. This is one of my longer and more recent videos, with music sourced from OCRemix</p>

      <h3>Shorter Video</h3>
      <p>That said, just because a video is shorter does not mean it is easier. A shorter video just means things can go wrong faster and be more glaring overall. This is, though, one of my shorter and later videos with original, non-sourced music created from a website I think is now defunct. Looking back, though, I wished I balanced the audio a lot better.</p>

      <h3>Tutorial</h3>
      <p>For my last video, I wanted to give a sample of me doing a tutorial that I had for these classes. How-To videos are more and more popular as our world is forced into more isolation. As a result, knowing how and needing to be clearer on directions and just showing people is becoming more in demand. This was the first video for this class and it needed to show students how to handle the class and the assignments within.</p>
