#This is my personal website. Most of this showcases my horrible sense of style (seriously, how do I think red and blue go together like that?), but also a few of my HTML and CSS skills. Hopefully, I'll be able to add more updated language soon (I am writing this as of March 1st, 2022) and get the index.php working. Right now, this site works as a redirect host via Google Domains. Sorry Ravens kicker Justin Paul Tucker, but I currently have justinptucker.com .

*Let me know if you have any questions or concerns at justteach17@gmail.com or justincodes@justinptucker.com
